The Lv 124 Norm is not the only standard for automotive testing. There are other norms and regulations that you may need to comply with, depending on the type and market of your vehicle. For example, there is the Lv 148 Norm, which is a complementary standard to the Lv 124 Norm. It specifies additional tests for high-voltage components and systems in electric and hybrid vehicles.
 
Another example is the ISO 26262 standard, which is an international standard for functional safety of electrical and electronic systems in road vehicles. It defines the requirements and processes for ensuring the safety of the system throughout its life cycle. The ISO 26262 standard is aligned with the IEC 61508 standard, which is a generic standard for functional safety of electrical, electronic, and programmable electronic systems.
 
If you want to learn more about these and other automotive standards, you can visit the websites of the organizations that develop and publish them. Some of these organizations are:

- The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) at [https://www.iso.org](https://www.iso.org).
- The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) at [https://www.iec.ch](https://www.iec.ch).
- The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) at [https://www.sae.org](https://www.sae.org).
- The Automotive Electronics Council (AEC) at [https://www.aecouncil.com](https://www.aecouncil.com).

These websites offer a wealth of information and resources on automotive standards and testing. You can also purchase or download the standards from their online stores or libraries.
